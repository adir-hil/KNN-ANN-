# KNN-ANN

The project was done as a part of Machine Learning course. <br>
The main goal of the project is to find matching dots between two images of the same place but from different angles by using the algorithms- KNN and ANN. <br>
The jupyter notebook contains among other things, a self-implementation of those algorithms using LSH in the main part, and using KD Tree in the bonus part. <br> <br>

There are two different datasets. <br>
The JPG files are the images that present the same place. <br>
The CSV files contain different dots that are described by 128 features for each. <br>
