# KNN-ANN

The project was done as a part of Machine Learning course. <br>
The main goal of the project is to find matching pixels between two images of the same scence but from different angles by using KNN and ANN. <br>
The jupyter notebook contains among other things, a self-implementation of those algorithms using LSH in the main part, and using KD Tree in the bonus part. <br>

Two inputs were given for the exercise:  <br>
- 2 pairs of JPG images, each pair describing a scence (two scences were given, Hananaya and Hashmal). <br>
- CSV files contain numeric representations of each image, each row represents a single pixel, with 128 features.<br>
